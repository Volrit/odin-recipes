            <li>1/4 cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups cooked white short-grain rice (such as Arborio or sushi rice)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk, divided</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>maple syrup (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine cinnamon, 3 tablespoons of the brown sugar, and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet. Cook over low, whisking constantly, until sauce is well combined, 1 to 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place bananas in an even layer directly over sauce. Cook over medium-low, flipping and stirring banana slices once halfway through, until bananas are golden brown and softened, about 6 minutes total.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set aside 1/2 cup of the banana mixture in a small bowl; stir in walnuts.
            <li>
                Mash banana mixture in skillet with a potato masher, over medium-low, until thick and mostly smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in rice, salt, nutmeg, 1 1/2 cups of the milk, and remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until thickened and most of the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk together egg yolk and remaining 1/2 cup milk in a small bowl until well combined. Stirring constantly, slowly drizzle into egg mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until pudding has thickened slightly and an instant-read thermometer reaches 165 degrees F (73 degrees C), about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; stir in vanilla and remaining 2 tablespoons butter until creamy and glossy, 1 to 2 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide pudding evenly between 2 bowls and top each bowl with 1/4 cup of the reserved banana mixture. Serve with maple syrup, and garnish with cinnamon just before serving, if desired. Serve warm, or let cool completely to room temperature before chilling overnight to serve cold.
