        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease and line 3 (8 inch) round cake pans with parchment paper; grease the parchment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, eggs, sour cream, oil, vanilla, and almond extract until completely smooth and combined. Add in the dry ingredients and whisk until mostly incorporated. Add in milk, and whisk until batter is mostly smooth. Batter will be runny.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out mostly clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow cakes to cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                To make jam syrup, mix together jam, water, and lemon juice in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave for 30 seconds, then stir until mixture is thoroughly combined. Brush jam syrup evenly over the top of cooled cakes.
            </li>
            <li>
                To make chantilly cream, beat together mascarpone and cream cheese on medium speed until smooth. Add in heavy cream, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt. Beginning on low speed and gradually increasing to medium high, beat mixture until it holds stiff peaks. Do not overbeat, or cream will curdle.
            </li>
            <li>
                To assemble, place 1 cake layer onto a plate or platter. Top with a hefty dollop of chantilly cream and spread into an even layer. Sprinkle 1/2 of berries over the top of the cream and gently press into the cream. Top with second cake layer, and repeat adding cream and berries. Top with the final cake layer. Cover top and sides of cake with remaining cream. 
            </li>

                Arrange remaining berries on top of cake as desired. Place cake into the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours before serving.Arrange remaining berries on top of cake as desired. Place cake into the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours before serving.
